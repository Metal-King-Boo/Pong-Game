# Pong!!!

This is a simple game of pong developed using Unity. It features musical and visual assets that I do not own. 
All credits to their original sources. This project is to get a feel of basic Unity2D.

Rules and Controls:
- The first to score 10 points wins the game
- The restart button will set the game back to 0-0

- Player 1 controls the left paddle with the W and S keys
- Player 2 controls the right paddle with Up and Down keys
